Set up HTML template, assign the css file into the html
In the body, I have set up a div with a class name to store up all image links
Find 9 characters and fill in the img attribute with images
Also assign classes to each image to interact with anyone of them if needed

In the CSS, write the name class name to interact with all images at once
Used the display:grid attribute to align all pictures
Then used the grid-template-columns and set it to 3 to have the 3x3 grid
